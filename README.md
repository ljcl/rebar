Rebar
=====

A Reddit toolbar for Safari in the vein of [Socialite](http://www.reddit.com/socialite/index.html) for Firefox and 
[reddit companion](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/algjnflpgoopkdijmkalfcifomdhmcbe) for Chrome.

When you click on a link from Reddit, Rebar will display the link's score and title, and provide you with buttons
to upvote, downvote, view comments, and save the link.

### Configuration


In order to upvote/downvote/save, you need to set your Reddit username/password in Preferences -> Extensions -> Rebar.
